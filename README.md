# CoronaViews
I made this repository to train my skills consuming an API, as well to get better insights about the data around the coronavirus.

## How to Use It?
Get all-time data per country:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/country/my_country
(Change 'my_country' for the country you want to query)

Get daily data per country:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/daily/my_country/01-01-2021
(Change 'my_country' for the country and '01-01-2021' for the day you want to query)
